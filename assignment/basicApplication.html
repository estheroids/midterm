        <p class="main">the  national flood insurance program (NFIP)
        is a federal insurance program managed by FEMA to
        reduce the impact of flooding on private and public structures. </p>

        <!--  by providing relatively affordable flood insurance to property owners,
                enforcing floodplain management regulations, and encouraging
                communities to adopt flood mitigation measures. -->

      <p class="main"> despite the fact that a significant portion of new york city is
        exposed to flood risk*, reports estimate that less than 20% of residential
        buildings in areas inundated by hurricane sandy in 2012 had NFIP coverage. </p>

      <p class = "main"> displayed on the map is the rockaway peninsula,
        a 11-mile community located in the borough of queens in new york city.
        it contains a range of different building types including single-family homes,
        town houses and high rises (including affordable and public housing).
        rockaway was severely impacted by hurricane sandy -
        which really shouldn't be surprising given its location along the coast,
        and the fact that almost the entire peninsula is located within the FEMA-designated floodplain
        (as seen on the map). </p>

    <h3 class="subheader">ROCKAWAY, QUEENS</h3>
    <p class = "main"> rockaway was devastated by hurricane sandy in october 2012.
      thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed by high water; particularly properties with basements.
      in addition, floodwater had caused fires in many areas in rockaway by contacting electrical wires or starting of vehicles.
      the fires were exacerbated by the flooding, which obstructed firefighters' access to those areas.
      the FDNY reported 130 homes burned to the ground and many others damaged by the fires.</p>

      <p class = "main">the land use in rockaway comprises primarily of lower-density residential
      buildings including one- and two-family homes and multi-family walkup buildings.
      these building types make up over 80% of land uses in the rockaway area, with
      the rest ranging from mixed-use, commercial, to multi-family elevator buildings.</p>
